    <p id ="intro">When many think of Astrology they think of the horoscope. Horoscopes give great insight into an individuals persona- However they have created some-what of a
        misconception within the realm of astrology by becoming monopolized in an a society that is constantly trying to give us our own image.
        With that being said, many have taken for-granted the tools it gives us to understand our own Psychology, and even spirituality.
        This approach dives deeper into the roots of Astrology and the mythology of its existence. <em>"It sometimes seems easier
            to develop elaborate schemes and theories rather than to open up our eyes to what's right in front of us" -Stephen Arroyo.</em></p>

    <h3>The birth of Astrology</h3>
    <p class="intro">Astrology has been being used for thousands of years, it has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE.
        A form of astrology was first practiced in the first dynasty of Mesopotamia given roots to Calendrical systems,
        to predict seasonal shifts and interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications.</p>

<h3>Astrology is a Mysterious Science </h3>
<article>
    <main class="main"> "This unity of, and relation between, humanity and the universe is really the only assumption upon which astrology is based."</main>
        <p id ="content">At once Astronomy and Astrology were the same science. Science? Yes science, in fact the oldest of sciences!
        The science of the stars, perhaps even the spirit. Astrology produces massive benefits allowing
        the first signs of civilisation to cultivate direction, expansion, and  predict the recurrence of seasons
        and certain divine celestial cycles. Stephen Arroyo, Author of Astrology, Psychology and the four elements talks
        about the re-structuring of Astrology- which began in the 1930's. Arroyo writes about the shift in mass consciousness
            that will allow new methods of interpretation and practice that gives humanity a unique and profound perception
            to there own psych in relation to the universe. He does point out that in order to comprehend how certain
            elements of the universe could possibly make up your existence once must think of such encounters as something
            that exists in your "inner world" meaning- what might make up your consciousness."It is true that one is born
            with a certain birth-chart, with a certain pattern of "karma" or emotional-mental-physical tendencies. However,
            the circumstances the one will confront are to a large extent programmed to what one expresses"- <em>Stephen Arroyo M.A</em></p>

<h4>Natal Charts a tool for self knowledge</h4>
<p>A Natal Chart can give you insights to the planetary aspects in which you were born or cosmic attunement to the four elements. It collects the data from the
    time, place, and date you were born.</p>
<h5>For example, lets take a look at my natal chart.</h5>
<img src="natalchart.jpg" alt = "Emmalee's Natal Chart" height="420" width="420"/>
<h5>Deciphering my Natal Chat would begin with determining which Signs correlate with what planets first of, I have
    my sun sign in Cancer, Moon in libra, Ascendant is in Scorpio, Mercury in Leo, Venus in Gemini, Mars in Gemini,
    Jupiter in Pisces, Saturn in Taurus, Uranus in Aquarius, Neptune in Aquarius, and Pluto in Sagittarius.There is much more to be explained but for now, know that
    each element means something</h5>

<p>Each Sign is defined by which house it lives in. Another way to interpret what each sign might mean, is to associate what element each sign aligns with.
    Why is this an accurate assessment? You might ask, Indeed all physical and mental life is a manifestation of energy.The elements can be seen as
    "the vital forces that make up the entire creation that can me perceived by the physical senses. <em>Manley P. Hall writes "The four elements</em>
are the basis of, as well as the life behind, the four physical material elements- earth, air, fire, and water. All things superior to those four
    essences can be cognized only by spiritual vision".</p>
